Each time a Audiotron was rebooted, the unit would try to access the internet
 and download a list of radio stations which were generically assigned by
 Turtle Beach but could be modified by logging in to the TurtleRadio web site.
 The Audiotron would call the page
 http://duncan.turtleradio.com/output/playlist.asp?m=XXXXXXX&client=audiotron&version=3_2_25
 where the XXXXXXX was your 7-digit member ID consisting of letters and numbers.

The page returned consisted of a single line XML formatted type string which
contained your station play list to configure the Audiotron. A typical output
is shown below and has been formatted with spaces/tabs for clarity:

<TBSTATIONS>
	<length>71340</length>
	<username>XXXXXXX</username>
	<ttl>7</ttl>
	<updateavail>false</updateavail>
	<stationcount>339</stationcount>
	<time>1174927288</time>
	<station>
                <id>2047</id>
                <category>Adult Contemporary</category>
                <title>Amped Out</title>
                <location>http://www.ampedout.net/ampedOut-128k.pls</location>
                <format>Shoutcast</format>
                <pa>null</pa>
        </station>
        <station>
                <id>9752</id>
                <category>Adult Contemporary</category>
                <title>Dub Beautiful Collective</title>
                <location>http://205.188.234.37:8024/listen.pls>
                <format>Shoutcast</format>
                <pa>null</pa>
        </station>
        <station>
		etc
        </station>
</TBSTATIONS>

The tag names have the following functions:

<length>

This is the length of the entire file in bytes. Remember the output consists of a single line of data with NO spaces.

<username>

This is your unique TurtleRadio 7 character alphanumerical member ID.

<ttl>

This stands for time to live and is the number of minutes that the feed is cached if obtained by a server.

<updateavail>

This value is unknown but may have been used to indicate station updates on the feed.

<time>

This is the time of the file request in seconds since 00:00:00 1970-01-01 UTC.

<station></station>

This defines each station record.

<category>

This defines the category or music type of the radio stream. This can be anything you like for category selection.

<title>

This defines the title of the radio station as shown on the AudioTron display.

<location>

This defines the station URL address for the stream.

<format>

This defines the format of the radio stream and can be either "Shoutcast", "Icecast", or "Windows Media".

<pa>

This value is unknown but has always been set to "null".

Luckily for Audiotron users, Turtle beach had the foresight to add a hidden feature
in the last firmware release to read the station list from a local text file rather
than using the TurtleRadio website. Although there was no intention in closing
TurtleRadio, this information was published in August 2005 after repeated requests
by the user base.
