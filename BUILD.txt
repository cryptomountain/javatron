JavaTron Build Information File
Version 1.0

1.0 Introduction

JavaTron's build system uses Ant.  If you do not have Ant, you will need
to download it and install it.  You can find Ant at :
http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/

2.0 Build File

JavaTron is built by from the default ant build file "build.xml".  You
will find this file at the root of the source tree.

By default, running "ant" will look for this file, and it will determine
from the file the default target to build.  For JavaTron the default
target is "compile".

3.0 Targets

JavaTron targets are described by build.xml.  They are:

init: initializes the build system
compile: compiles the source tree (/src) into the build tree (/build)
dist-src: creates a source distributable
dist-jar: creates an executable distributable
dist: all distributables
clean: cleans all temporary build files
all: all targets except 'clean'

4.0 Directory Layout

/src : the source files
/conf : configuration files
/build : where build files go
/dist : where dist files go
/docs : reference docs for developers
