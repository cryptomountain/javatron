ABOUT

JavaTron is a Java application that controls a TurtleBeach 
AudioTron Network MP3 player.  It provides simple buttons for
player controls such as play, pause, stop etc., as well as
sophisticated playlist management and display.

USAGE

java -jar javatron-2.2.7.jar [audiotron-ip] [username] [password]

VERSION INFO

This version works with TurtleBeach AudioTron Firmware 2.5.2.  It
may not work with later revisions.  

Use JavaTron 2.2.2 or less if your firmware revision is less than
2.5.2.  

NOTES

: Save Settings (IP Address, Username, Password)
You can save the AudioTron IP address, username, and password 
from the "Prefs" screen which is located by pressing the "Prefs"
button from the main screen.

The default tab is the "Preferences:General" tab which contains
the settings for the IP Address, username and password.  Once
they are set, press the save button located in the lower right
hand corner of the dialog box.  This will save a file called
"javatron.prefs" in the JavaTron current directory.

There is currently no install/uninstall program so you will
have to remove this file yourself if you want to reset to the
defaults or are uninstalling JavaTron.

: General
JavaTron keeps cached information about the songs your AudioTron
has indexed.  If you need to clear this state (if you reboot the
AudioTron and there are new files in your music share(s)) you will
need to restart JavaTron.
